# Deep Default Dark+ Theme for VS Code

A slightly darker version of VS Code's **Default Dark+** theme.  

Cooler color temperature and more vibrant colors are also available.  

Suggestions and pull requests are welcome on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/danielmeeusen/deep-default-dark-vscode-theme).
